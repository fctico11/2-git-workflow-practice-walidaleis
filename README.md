## My comments
The title of this article caught my eye as it initially got me thinking AI was already starting to replace software engineers. Upon reading the article, it reaffirmed my prior belief that AI will remain, at least for the foreseeable future, a supplement to the work of software engineers. The article then prompted me to wonder how commercialized such AI tools will eventually become, and whether they should and will be free and open-source instead. As more and more such tools like Cognizant's Flowsource emerge, the greater competition could hopefully bring down prices.

### Additional Comments
fctico11: I too had the belief that AI was already in the process of taking over SE jobs, but it's also reaffirming to know that it could just be another tool in a software engineers shed!
